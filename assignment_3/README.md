To run this solution:
* change directories into this folder
* start julia: 'julia'
* run the startup.jl file: 'include("startup.jl")'
* run the solution.jl file: 'include("solution.jl")'

The solution only outputs the norms of the final configuration errors using control_PD! and control_CTC!. If you wish to view the animations, you can go into the solution.jl file and uncomment lines 67 and 94 to see parts 2 and 3 visualized.
